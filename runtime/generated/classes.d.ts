   * Lazily evaluated table. For performance reasons, we sometimes return a custom table-like type instead of a native Lua table. This custom type lazily constructs the necessary Lua wrappers of the corresponding C++ objects, therefore preventing their unnecessary construction in some cases.
   *
   * There are some notable consequences to the usage of a custom table type rather than the native Lua table type: Iterating a custom table is only possible using the `pairs` Lua function; `ipairs` won't work. Another key difference is that custom tables cannot be serialised into a game save file -- if saving the game would require serialisation of a custom table, an error will be displayed and the game will not be saved.
   *
   * In previous versions of Factorio, this would create a {@link LuaPlayer} instance for every player in the game, even though only one such wrapper is needed. In the current version, accessing {@link LuaGameScript#players game.players} by itself does not create any {@link LuaPlayer} instances; they are created lazily when accessed. Therefore, this example only constructs one {@link LuaPlayer} instance, no matter how many elements there are in `game.players`.
   *
   * ```
   * game.players["Oxyd"].character.die()
   * ```
   *
   * This statement will execute successfully and `storage.p` will be useable as one might expect. However, as soon as the user tries to save the game, a "LuaCustomTable cannot be serialized" error will be shown. The game will remain unsaveable so long as `storage.p` refers to an instance of a custom table.
   *
   * ```
   * storage.p = game.players  -- This has high potential to make the game unsaveable
   * ```
   *
   * The following will produce no output because `ipairs` is not supported with custom tables.
   *
   * ```
   * for _, p in ipairs(game.players) do game.player.print(p.name); end  -- incorrect; use pairs instead
   * ```
   * @example
   * -- Custom tables may be iterated using `pairs`.
   * for _, p in pairs(game.players) do game.player.print(p.name); end

   * An element of a custom GUI. This type is used to represent {@link GuiElementType any kind} of a GUI element - labels, buttons and frames are all instances of this type. Just like {@link LuaEntity}, different kinds of elements support different attributes; attempting to access an attribute on an element that doesn't support it (for instance, trying to access the `column_count` of a `textfield`) will result in a runtime error.
   *
   * For information on all supported GUI elements, see {@link GuiElementType}.
   *
   * Each GUI element allows access to its children by having them as attributes. Thus, one can use the `parent.child` syntax to refer to children. Lua also supports the `parent["child"]` syntax to refer to the same element. This can be used in cases where the child has a name that isn't a valid Lua identifier.
   * @example
   * -- This will add a label called "greeting" to the top flow.
   * -- Immediately after, it will change its text to illustrate accessing child elements.
   * game.player.gui.top.add{type="label", name="greeting", caption="Hi"}
   * game.player.gui.top.greeting.caption = "Hello there!"
   * game.player.gui.top["greeting"].caption = "Actually, never mind, I don't like your face"
   * @example
   * -- This will add a tabbed-pane and 2 tabs with contents.
   * local tabbed_pane = game.player.gui.top.add{type="tabbed-pane"}
   * local tab1 = tabbed_pane.add{type="tab", caption="Tab 1"}

- Added `AchievmentType`, `EntityType`, `EquipmentType`, and `ItemType` types, which lists all typenames for the
  specific prototype type.
- In runtime types, the values for `type` and `ghost_type` attributes are specified to be specific prototype typenames
  when possible. For instance, `LuaEntity.type` now has type `EntityType` instead of `string`.

# v2.0.0

## New features

- Added complete types for the prototype stage! See the README for more details.

## Breaking changes

- With the addition of prototype stage types, types are no longer global. Instead, types are divided into the "virtual"
  modules `"factorio:settings"`, `"factorio:prototype"`, and `"factorio:runtime"`.
  - The `defines` and `serpent` namespaces are still global.
- The placeholder types for the data and settings stage have been removed; see the README for how to add the full types.
- The "strict index types" option is now always applied (no longer an opt-in feature).
- The deprecated `Read` types have been removed.

## Other changes

- In online documentation links, the specific factorio version instead of "latest".
- Documentation comments updated to be more similar to the online documentation.

### BREAKING

- Read-only forms of concepts (the most common form used) is now specified with just the name; forms with a `Read` or
  `Table` suffix have been removed.
- Write forms are now specified as either a union of table and array forms, or with a `Write` suffix for concepts.
  - For table-or-array concepts: `MapPositionRead` -> `MapPosition`, `MapPosition` -> `MapPosition | PositionArray`
  - For table concepts: `ScriptAreaRead` -> `ScriptArea`, `ScriptArea` -> `ScriptAreaWrite`
- The minimum TSTL version has been increased to v1.6.1 (A bug with documentation comments was fixed in that version).

### Other

- Updated to factorio version 1.1.63.
- Upgraded to factorio api docs json version 3.
- The new type `nil` is used instead of `undefined` (they are equivalent).

- Add manually defined overload for LuaControl::teleport().

# v1.3.1

# v1.3.0

- Updated to factorio version 1.1.61

# v1.2.0

- Updated to factorio version 1.1.60

# v1.1.0

  compatibility for future releases.
- Updated to factorio version 1.1.57

# v0.20.0

- Updated to factorio version 1.1.56
- This is an **opt-in** feature: Some numeric types which represent indices/number,e.g. player_index, entity_number, are
  now branded numbers with their own type, e.g. `PlayerIndex` and `EntityNumber`. See the README for more info.
- Added custom-index-template.d.ts to assist trying out custom changes to types in a project.

# v0.19.0

- Updated to factorio version 1.1.53
- Updated to json api version 2
- Improved documentation comments

## Changes

- `Position`, `PositionArray`, and `PositionTable` have been replaced by `MapPosition`, `MapPositionArray`, and
  `MapPositionTable` respectively. These are now deprecated and may be removed in a future version.

# v0.18.1

- `TechnologyIdentification` now also has a more specific type when read.

# v0.18.0

- `ForceIdentification` and `ItemPrototypeIdentification` now have more specific types when read.
- Properties which represent a flag concept now have the correct specific type, instead of `string`.

# v0.17.1

- Fixed documentation links for events

# v0.17.0

- Updated to factorio version 1.1.52

# v0.16.0

- `LuaCustomTable` can be iterated on in a for-of loop directly (without using `pairs`). This requires TSTL v1.3.0 or
  later.
- TSTL dependency minimum version is now v1.3.0.

# v0.15.0

- Table or array concepts are now declared in table form wherever it is an "read" position.
  - This works with setter overloading for applicable properties: `player.color.x; player.color = [1, 1, 1]` is now
    valid!
  - This also applies to concepts/complex types which contain table_or_array properties.
- Some concepts now also have a special form where it is known to be in a "read" position, where all table_or_array
  concepts are declared in table form. These concepts are suffixed with "Read", e.g. `ScriptAreaRead`.
- Arrays which are known to be in a "write" only form (e.g. method parameters) now are marked readonly. This means you
  can now pass readonly arrays to these methods.
- `MapPosition` is now a table or array concept.
- Classes with subclasses are now declared with all properties, instead of an intersection of subclasses (reversion)
- Subclass specializations added for some missing classes

# v0.14.1

- LuaStyle: `extra_margin/padding_when_activated` is now for subclass scroll_pane

# v0.14.0

- LuaStyle size, margin/padding setters now have more specific array types. These array types are `SizeArray` and
  `StyleValuesArray` for size and margin/padding, respectively.
- `@noSelf` annotation is now only present when necessary.
- For classes with subclasses:
  - The original class name (e.g. `LuaItemStack`) still contains attributes of all subclasses (same as before).
  - There is now a `Base` type (e.g. `BaseItemStack`) which only includes attributes common to all subclasses.
  - There is a separate type definition for each subclass, e.g. `BlueprintItem`. Note that one instance may still
    belong to multiple subclasses (the subclasses are not mutually exclusive).
  - The above two can be optionally used for stricter types.

# v0.13.2

- Fix: ChooseElemButtonSpec filters should be named elem_filters

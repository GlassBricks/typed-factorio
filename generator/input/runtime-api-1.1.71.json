This type is used to represent any kind of a GUI element - labels, buttons and frames are all instances of this type. Just like [LuaEntity](LuaEntity), different kinds of elements support different attributes; attempting to access an attribute on an element that doesn't support it (for instance, trying to access the `column_count` of a `textfield`) will result in a runtime error.\n\nThe following types of GUI element are supported:\n\n- `\"button\"`: A clickable element. Relevant event: [on_gui_click](on_gui_click)\n- `\"sprite-button\"`: A `button` that displays a sprite rather than text. Relevant event: [on_gui_click](on_gui_click)\n- `\"checkbox\"`: A clickable element with a check mark that can be turned off or on. Relevant event: [on_gui_checked_state_changed](on_gui_checked_state_changed)\n- `\"flow\"`: An invisible container that lays out its children either horizontally or vertically.\n- `\"frame\"`: A non-transparent box that contains other elements. It can have a title (set via the `caption` attribute). Just like a `flow`, it lays out its children either horizontally or vertically. Relevant event: [on_gui_location_changed](on_gui_location_changed)\n- `\"label\"`: A piece of text.\n- `\"line\"`: A horizontal or vertical separation line.\n- `\"progressbar\"`: A partially filled bar that can be used to indicate progress.\n- `\"table\"`: An invisible container that lays out its children in a specific number of columns. The width of each column is determined by the widest element it contains.\n- `\"textfield\"`: A single-line box the user can type into. Relevant events: [on_gui_text_changed](on_gui_text_changed), [on_gui_confirmed](on_gui_confirmed)\n- `\"radiobutton\"`: A clickable element that is functionally identical to a `checkbox`, but has a circular appearance. Relevant event: [on_gui_checked_state_changed](on_gui_checked_state_changed)\n- `\"sprite\"`: An element that shows an image.\n- `\"scroll-pane\"`: An invisible element that is similar to a `flow`, but has the ability to show and use scroll bars.\n- `\"drop-down\"`: A drop-down containing strings of text. Relevant event: [on_gui_selection_state_changed](on_gui_selection_state_changed)\n- `\"list-box\"`: A list of strings, only one of which can be selected at a time. Shows a scroll bar if necessary. Relevant event: [on_gui_selection_state_changed](on_gui_selection_state_changed)\n- `\"camera\"`: A camera that shows the game at the given position on the given surface. It can visually track an [entity](LuaGuiElement::entity) that is set after the element has been created.\n- `\"choose-elem-button\"`: A button that lets the player pick from a certain kind of prototype, with optional filtering. Relevant event: [on_gui_elem_changed](on_gui_elem_changed)\n- `\"text-box\"`: A multi-line `textfield`. Relevant event: [on_gui_text_changed](on_gui_text_changed)\n- `\"slider\"`: A horizontal number line which can be used to choose a number. Relevant event: [on_gui_value_changed](on_gui_value_changed)\n- `\"minimap\"`: A minimap preview, similar to the normal player minimap. It can visually track an [entity](LuaGuiElement::entity) that is set after the element has been created.\n- `\"entity-preview\"`: A preview of an entity. The [entity](LuaGuiElement::entity) has to be set after the element has been created.\n- `\"empty-widget\"`: An empty element that just exists. The root GUI elements `screen` and `relative` are `empty-widget`s.\n- `\"tabbed-pane\"`: A collection of `tab`s and their contents. Relevant event: [on_gui_selected_tab_changed](on_gui_selected_tab_changed)\n- `\"tab\"`: A tab for use in a `tabbed-pane`.\n- `\"switch\"`: A switch with three possible states. Can have labels attached to either side. Relevant event: [on_gui_switch_state_changed](on_gui_switch_state_changed)\n\nEach GUI element allows access to its children by having them as attributes. Thus, one can use the `parent.child` syntax to refer to children. Lua also supports the `parent[\"child\"]` syntax to refer to the same element. This can be used in cases where the child has a name that isn't a valid Lua identifier.","examples":["This will add a label called `greeting` to the top flow.

Cliffs are placed along certain contours according to [CliffPlacementSettings](CliffPlacementSettings).\n- `cliffiness` - determines whether (when >0.5) or not (when <0.5) a cliff will be placed at an otherwise suitable (according to [CliffPlacementSettings](CliffPlacementSettings)) location.\n- `enemy-base-intensity` - a number that is referenced by both `enemy-base-frequency` and `enemy-base-radius`. i.e. if this is overridden, enemy base frequency and size will both be affected and do something reasonable.
